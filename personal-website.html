        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Griffin Egan, and I am currently a senior at Rutgers Business School in New Brunswick, NJ majoring in Business Analytics and Information Technology with a concentration in Finance.
             This major encouraged me as I have a passion for connecting real business applications into the growing technology world.
              I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, and Excel where they have given my the analytical tools that I need to accomplish my goals.</p>
